**Write a Java application that handles multiple ATM transactions (withdraw, deposit) at the same time.**
*This exercise is similar to PrintTask example from Week 12.*

- [x] Create an Account class and implement both deposit and withdraw operations.
- [x] Synchronize the operations to allow thread synchronization.
